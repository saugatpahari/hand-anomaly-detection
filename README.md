Project Description:

This project aims to develop a system using an ESP32 module and an MPU6050 sensor to track and analyze human movement for medical purposes. The ESP32, with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, will communicate with an Android device or cloud for real-time data transmission. The MPU6050 sensor will capture 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data to measure tilt and movement, which will be processed by the ESP32 and analyzed using machine learning algorithms for accuracy.

The system will help doctors monitor patients remotely, and in the future, it can be adapted to track animals' behavior. The approach uses object-oriented programming to process the data, with results sent to an Android app to assess if movement falls within a normal range.
